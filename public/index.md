# Introduction

The [Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) is a methodology for building resilient, robust, and scalable production applications. Twelve-factor development is an adaptation of that methodology for the development process.

Twelve-factor development environments:

- Use declarative formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project;
- Do not require manual work to get to a ready-to-code state;
- Are compatible with developers' chosen operating systems, shells, and IDEs;
- Declare all dependencies, for both development and production, including system tools;
- Do not need to be actively maintained to eliminate configuration drift or prepare for further development;
- Minimize divergence between development and production, enabling continuous deployment for maximum agility;

The twelve-factor methodology can be applied to apps written in any programming language, and which use any combination of backing services (database, queue, memory cache, etc).
