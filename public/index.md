# Introduction

Continuous development is a methodology for building software applications with development environments that are **isolated**, **automated**, **adaptable**, and **transparent**.

> A development environment (also called a workspace) includes the developer's code editor or IDE, the running application code, and the machine the application code runs on.

Developing software in environments that do not have these properties means accepting the impediments caused by them.

- Poor isolation leads to unpredictable side-effects and compatibility issues. - Poor automation leads to complex internal states that are not easily reversible.
- Inflexible environments do not provide developers with the agency to use the tools they need.
- Black-boxes obscure the necessary information required to debug issues.

The goal of continuous development is to **improve the developer experience by removing sources of friction and frustration.**

Continuous principles can be applied to all development operations, regardless of software, hardware, or team size.
